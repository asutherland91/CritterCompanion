You see upon each sea star's arm sprout many dozens of tiny feet. YES, FEET! They use these suction-cupped feet not just to move about...but to...eh... grab hold of dinner guests as well. Finally, it should be noted that when a sea star loses an arm, it can grow it back. More impressive yes, a served sea star arm...can sometimes grow an entire sea star body back!"

## Introduction
Welcome to Critter Companion an application designed to track the critters you have caught and all the ones you are still looking for in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It provides information about critter availability, value, and the time of day/year they can be found. With this application, users can easily identify which critters they are missing from their collection and information to help find them.

## Wins
- Successfully incorporated and leveraged data from an unfamiliar API to enrich the application's capabilities.
- Skillfully devised and adhered to user stories, ensuring that the features met the needs of our intended users.
- Thoroughly examined user flows through comprehensive testing, implementing robust error handling mechanisms to handle any potential issues.
- Worked quickly and efficently in order to produce a well-rounded and clean application.

## Challenges & Improvements
- Cypress testing was certainly my biggest challenge, but I did successfully and thoroughly test my application.
  - Possible future improvements and features:
    - Incorperate better responsiveness to allow for clean usage on many devices of different sizes.
    - Adding in the ability to choose what hemisphere the user resides in and have the update the critters avaliability times.
    - Allowing users to be able to sort out what creatures are available at the time as a list rather than searching each critter for its availability.
